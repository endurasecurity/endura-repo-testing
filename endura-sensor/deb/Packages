 ## ADDITIONAL CHECKS:
 .
 - Inventory of libraries being used
 .
 ## ISSUES
 .
 ### ISSUE: multiple updates needed for endura standalone deployment support
 .
 [x] - "endura sensor stop" should either fail if running jobs (preferred) or
 forcefully remove all existing jobs
 -> necessary for "systemctl stop endura-sensor.service" to not silently break
 protection for other jobs
 .
 [x] - "endura job stop" should support either job id or job workspace, or
 possibly just the workspace itself
 -> no way to know previous job id in ExecStart and ExecStop systemd context
 .
 [x] - need to pretty print violations in logs, as no ui to better triage
 .
 ### ISSUE: job stop fails for mkosi demo after running for over 5 mins
 .
 2025-05-23T16:55:10.020002Z ERROR main endura: command failed error=job stop
 failed
 Caused by:
     no record found for Query { name:
 Name("193-36-143-63.static.reverse.lstn.net."), query_type: AAAA, query_class:
 IN } source=Some("no record found for Query { name:
 Name(\"193-36-143-63.static.reverse.lstn.net.\"), query_type: AAAA,
 query_class: IN }")
 .
 ### ISSUE: io_uring is async where syscalls not invoked
 .
 - need tests to verify that fentry/LSMs/tracepoints stil invoked correctly
 .
 ### ISSUE: name resolution is insufficient
 .
 - resolves to one ip on load but another when customer app runs
 - consider blocking dns resolution in the kernel itself
 .
 ### ISSUE: allow expression of ip address range in net connect/bind policies;
 better support for cloud ip ranges
 .
 - ex: 140.82.[111-114].[33-34]
 - dynamically lookup ip ranges for github.com, gitlab.com, etc.
 .
 ### ISSUE: need to implement ENDURA_SENSOR_KEY
 .
 ### QUESTION: musl threading performance issues
 .

 - adopt mimalloc? already implemented. no metrics to assess impact!!
